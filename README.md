# Project 

What makes this project interesting is that there is no backend. The front use github to retrieve the benchmarks. So to upload a benchmark you just have to push it on this repo and it will be shown on the server.

The front is in vue.js with Material UI

# Installation ðŸ“š

`npm install`

for development: `npm start`

for build: `npm build`

You can easily host this project yourself by replacing the repo link in the Home.vue file, might do an env variable for that in the future. Then you can host the front like myself on vercell or anything that hosts web pages.

# Story of the project ðŸŽ©
